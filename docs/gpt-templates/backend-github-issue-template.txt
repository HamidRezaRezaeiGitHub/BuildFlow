- 'mvn -q -DskipTests=false clean test' and 'mvn -q -DskipTests=true package' complete without errors.
- Related README.md files are updated if necessary. 
- Update Files Structure of README.md at the root of the project, if new files/modules are added (or removed).

### ðŸ§© Example

Title:
[backend] Implement estimate calculation service â€” Estimation module

Context:
Estimation logic is mixed into controllers; we need a dedicated service for testability and reuse.

Read before acting:
- [backend] EstimateService.java
- [backend] EstimateServiceTest.java

Acceptance Criteria:
- Service supports AVERAGE and LATEST strategies.
- Unit tests cover both strategies and edge cases (no quotes).
- 'mvn -q -DskipTests=false clean test' and 'mvn -q -DskipTests=true package' complete without errors.
- README.md in the estimation module is updated with usage examples.
- Update Files Structure of README.md at the root of the project, if new files/modules are added (or removed).

Constraints & Hints:
- Keep calculation pure; avoid I/O in service methods.
- Controller delegates to the service via clear interfaces.
