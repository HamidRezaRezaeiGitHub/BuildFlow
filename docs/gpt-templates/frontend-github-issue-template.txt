Title:
[frontend] Fix DevPanel visibility â€” AppRouter integration

Context:
DevPanel is rendered via AppRouter but disappears on small screens. Visibility should depend on the config flag only, not viewport size.

Read before acting:
- [frontend] AppRouter.tsx
- [frontend] DevPanel.tsx

Acceptance Criteria:
- DevPanel visible when configuration is enabled across all breakpoints.
- No overlap with bottom navbar or FAB on mobile.
- 'npm run test', 'npm run lint', and 'npm run build' complete without errors.
- README.md in the frontend module is updated if necessary.
- Update Files Structure of README.md at the root of the project, if new files/modules are added (or removed).

Constraints & Hints:
- Likely hidden by responsive classes (`hidden sm:block`, etc.) or wrapper CSS.
- Keep changes localizedâ€”avoid refactoring unrelated components.
