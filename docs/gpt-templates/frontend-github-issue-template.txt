Title:
[frontend] Fix DevPanel visibility â€” AppRouter integration

Context:
DevPanel is rendered via AppRouter but disappears on small screens. Visibility should depend on the config flag only, not viewport size.

Read before acting:
- src/router/AppRouter.tsx
- src/components/DevPanel.tsx

Acceptance Criteria:
- DevPanel visible when configuration is enabled across all breakpoints.
- No overlap with bottom navbar or FAB on mobile.
- 'npm run test', 'npm run lint', and 'npm run build' complete without errors.

Constraints & Hints:
- Likely hidden by responsive classes (`hidden sm:block`, etc.) or wrapper CSS.
- Keep changes localizedâ€”avoid refactoring unrelated components.

Deliverables:
- List of modified files with a one-line rationale per file.
- Test plan covering mobile (â‰¤767px) and desktop (â‰¥1024px) widths.
